			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<p>The purpose of this site is to be a fun, interactive, and informative website about Avatar: The Last Airbender and The Legend of Korra.</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Audience</h3>
			<p>The target audience are Avatar: The Last Airbender and The Legend of Korra fans that are between the ages of 10 and 60 years of age.</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
			<p>I will include various different Javascript elements. I will make a Avatar quote generator that randomly choses from an array of Avatar Quotes. There will be key value pairs linked with every character. There will be a lot of pictures on the "Character Deep Dive" page. So I will make the pictures become big screen pictures that you can view, if you click on them. I also want to inlcude a registration page for people to register as a bender member. I will also add a character information page with a working search bar for people to look up information about Avatar characters. Another page I plan to include, is a Avatar Trivia quiz. I plan to just code the frontend code, which means the answers will be available in the source code. If the quiz is a little too hard to make, than I won't include that part.</p>

			<h2>Branding</h2>
			<h3>Website Logo (Orange color is the navbar color)</h3>

			<h2>Style Guide</h2>

			<!-- ------------------------Steps 4-8------------------------------ -->

			<h3>Color Palette</h3>
			<!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

			<!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below Make sure to paste it into both spots -->
			Palette URL:

			<table class="colors">

			<p>There will also be pictures of everyone who has quotes in the array.</p>
			<h3>Character Deep Dives</h3>
			<p>Aang, the central character of Avatar: The Last Airbender, is a complex and beloved figure.

				He is the Avatar, a reincarnation cycle destined to maintain balance in the world. As the Avatar, Aang possesses the ability to bend all four elements: air, water, earth, and fire.</p>
			<p>Aang's True Potential: Some fans speculate that Aang never fully realized his potential as the Avatar. While he mastered the four elements, there's a belief that he could have achieved even greater heights, perhaps even bending energy itself.
				The Air Nomad Legacy: Aang's connection to the Air Nomads and their culture is a significant aspect of his character. Some theories suggest that he may have had a deeper understanding of Air Nomad history and philosophy than initially portrayed.
				The Avatar State: Aang's Avatar State is a powerful transformation that grants him immense strength and skill. Some fans theorize that he could have learned to control this state more precisely, allowing him to utilize its power without losing consciousness.   
				The Role of the Moon Spirit: The Moon Spirit plays a crucial role in the balance of the waterbending element. Some fans speculate that Aang may have had a unique connection to the Moon Spirit, influencing his waterbending abilities.</p>
				<p>I will include an array of the prominent main characters to reuse the HTML and dynamically add character cards with similar information that ties to the characters. I will also reuse the image cards from the first page. I will also put a search bar to look up characters.</p>
			
			<h3>(IF I HAVE TIME) Trivia Quiz</h3>
			<p>If I have time I will make a trivia quiz with just the frontend HTML, CSS, and Javascript.</p>

			<h3>(IF I HAVE TIME) Become Bender Member</h3>


			<h2>Wireframes</h2>
			<p>
				Create two wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them
				here
			</p>

			<h3>Home</h3>
			<p>
				I may turn the hero image into a full width hero with the text over the picture. Depending on how it looks with the picture I choose decide what will happen. I also hope to finish the pages mentioned in the Navigation bar The "New Quote" button will allow the user to randomly generate a quote from a character. This will dynamically be added.
			</p>
			<img src="images/wireframe1.png" alt="home page wireframe" />

			<h3>Character Deep Dive</h3>
			<p>
				The Bender Type Tags and Nation Tags will look more like a tag or unclickable button when finished. The search bar will also be able to search for characters and dynamically add it to the page.
